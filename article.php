  <h3>No, motherfucker</h3>
  <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria
    and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear.
     But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow
     it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
     may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
      ends. </p>

  <h3>Hold on to your butts</h3>
  <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun
    is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that
    shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
    popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>

  <h3>I'm serious as a heart attack</h3>
  <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you
     happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna
     kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong
     to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this
      case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>
  <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the
    selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
    and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly
    his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
     thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and
      destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance
       upon thee. </p>
